<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Packaging the classes into the package <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> </li>
<li>Randomizing the arrival and service times </li>
<li>Object-oriented design with possibly a mix of imperative/declarative (functional) implementations</li>
<li>Program style: adherance to <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/style/" target="_blank">CS2030 Java Style Guide</a> </li>
<li>Java documentation: adherence to <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/javadoc" target="_blank">CS2030 Javadoc Specification</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>Problem Description</h4>
<p>For this lab, you will extend the simulator to model the more complex behavior of shops, servers, and customers. Specically,</p>
<ul>
<li>FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues for customers with a given maximum capacity</li>
<li>Two new events      
<ul>
<li><tt>SERVER_REST</tt> that simulates a server taking a rest, and </li>
<li><tt>SERVER_BACK</tt> that simulates a server returning back from rest </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two types of servers,       
<ul>
<li><em>human servers</em> who may rest after serving a customer, and </li>
<li><em>self-checkout counters</em> that never rest </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two types of customers      
<ul>
<li><em>typical</em> customers that joins the first queue (scanning from server 1 onwards) that is still not full, and </li>
<li><em>greedy</em> customers that joins the queue with the fewest waiting customers </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Customer Queues</h4>
<p>Each human server now has a queue of customers to allow multiple customers to queue up.  A customer that chooses to join a queue joins at the tail.   When a server is done serving a customer, it serves the next waiting customer at the head of the queue.   Hence, the queue should be a first-in-first-out (FIFO) structure.   <strong>The self-checkout counters, however, have only a single shared queue.</strong></p>
<h4>Taking a Rest</h4>
<p>The human servers are allowed to take occasional breaks.  When a server finishes serving a customer, there is a probability <tt>P<sub>r</sub></tt> that the server takes a rest for a random amount of time <tt>T<sub>r</sub></tt>.  During the break, the server does not serve the next waiting customer.  Upon returning from the break, the server serves the next customer in the queue immediately.</p>
<p>To implement this behavior, introduce two new events, <tt>SERVER_REST</tt> and <tt>SERVER_BACK</tt>, to simulating taking a break, and returning.  These events should be generated and scheduled in the simulator when the server decides to rest.</p>
<h4>Self-Checkout</h4>
<p>To reduce waiting time, self-checkout counters have been set-up. <!-- for customers who just need a quick service.--> These self-checkout counters never need to rest.  Customers queue up for the self-checkout counter in the same way as <em>human</em> servers.  There is one shared queue for all self-checkout counter.   <!-- However, only customers with service time lower than a Tself can join self-checkout queue. Tself is a parameter to be read from the input file. --></p>
<h4>Customers' Choice of Queue</h4>
<p>As before, when a customer arrives, he or she first scans through the servers (in order, from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>) to see if there is an idle server (i.e. not serving a customer and not resting).  If there is one, the customer will go to the server to be served.   Otherwise, a typical customer just chooses the first queue (while scanning from servers <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>) that is still not full to join.   However, other than the typical customer, a <em>greedy</em> customer is introduced that always chooses the queue with the fewest customers to join.   In the case of a tie, the customer breaks the tie by choosing the first one while scanning from servers <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>.</p>
<p>If a customer cannot find any queue to join, it will leave the shop.  <!-- If the customer requires a service time less then  Tself, it will look for an idle self-checkout counter first. Failing which it will look for an idle human server. If the customer fails to find any idle server (self-checkout and human server), it will try to join the queue at the self-checkout counters. The behavior of a customer joining the queue at the self-checkout counters is exactly the same as if the self-checkout counters are human servers.  If the queue at the self-checkout counters is full, or the customer requires a longer service (service time is no less than Tself, then the customer joins one of the queues of the (human) servers. The same greedy / no-greedy behavior applies. --></p>
<h4>Randomized Arrival and Service Time</h4>
<p>Simulation of different arrival and service times is achieved via random number generation.  A random number generator is an entity that generates one random number after another.  Since it is not possible to generate a truly random number algorithmically, pseudo random number generation is adopted instead. A pseudo-random number generator can be initialized with a seed, such that the same seed always produces the same sequence of (seemingly random) numbers.</p>
<p>Although, Java provides a class <tt>java.util.Random</tt>, an alternative <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class that is more suitable for discrete event simulation is provided for you that encapsulates different random number generators for use in our simulator.  Each random number generator generates a different stream of random numbers. The constructor for <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> takes in three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>int seed</tt> is the base seed. Each random number generator uses its own seed that is derived from this base seed; </li>
<li><tt>double lambda</tt> is the arrival rate, &lambda;; </li>
<li><tt>double mu</tt> is the service rate, &mu;. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>inter-arrival time</strong> is usually modeled as an exponential random variable, characterized by a single parameter <tt>&lambda;</tt> denoting the arrival rate.  <!-- Mathematically, the inter-arrival time can be generated with &minus;ln(U)/&lambda;, where U is a random variable between 0 and 1. --> The <tt>genInterArrivalTime()</tt> method of the class <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> is used for this purpose. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>start the simulation by generating the first customer arrival event with timestamp <tt>0</tt></li>
<!--
<li>generate all other arrival events and schedule it; </li>
-->
<li>if there are still more customers to simulate, generate the next arrival event with a timestamp of <tt>T + now</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is generated with the method <tt>genInterArrivalTime()</tt>; </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>service time</strong> is modeled as an exponential random variable, characterized by a single parameter, service rate &mu;. The method <tt>genServiceTime()</tt> from the class <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> can be used to generate the service time. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>each time a customer is being served, a <tt>DONE</tt> event is generated and scheduled; </li>
<li>the <tt>DONE</tt> event generated will have a timestamp of <tt>T  + now</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is generated with the method <tt>genServiceTime()</tt>. </li>
</ul>
<p>You may refer to the API of the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class  <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/RandomGenerator">here</a>.  The class file can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/RandomGenerator/RandomGenerator.class">here</a>. <!-- that encapsulates a pseudo-random number generator. We can create a random number generator with a seed:
<pre>
Random rng = new Random(1);
</pre>
We can then call rng.nextDouble() repeatedly to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. --></p>
<p>As usual, you will need to keep track of the following statistics:</p>
<ol>
<li>the average waiting time for customers who have been served </li>
<li>the number of customers served </li>
<li>the number of customers who left without being served </li>
</ol>
<h4>Using the <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> package</h4>
<p>Recall that Java has a higher-level of abstraction barrier called a package.  <!-- So far, you have been creating classes in the default package. --> First, create  <!-- the <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> package --> a directory <tt>cs2030/simulator</tt> where the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class will reside. <!-- that will be used for the next part.</p>
--></p>
<p>All classes dealing with the simulation should now reside in the <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> package, with the <tt>Main</tt> class importing the necessary classes from the package.</p>
<h4>Program Style</h4>
<p>Check for styling errors by invoking <tt>checkstyle</tt>. For example, to check styling for all java files</p>
<pre>$ java -jar checkstyle-8.2-all.jar -c cs2030_checks.xml *.java
</pre>
<p>A copy of the files for checkstyle is available in LumiNUS -- Files -- Miscellaneous.</p>
<h4>Writing and Generating Javadoc</h4>
<p>You are to document your classes and methods with Javadoc comments.  <!-- You should document all your methods and classes (including private ones). --> For more details, see the <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/javadoc">javadoc</a> guide.</p>
<h4>The Task</h4>
<p>This task is divided into several levels. <!-- Read through all the levels  to see how the different levels are related. <b>You may start from any level.</b> --> As there are progressively more input through the levels, specific details will be provided in the corresponding levels. Output for the level still comprises of the individual discrete events, and also the statistics at the end of the simulation.</p>
<p>Take note of the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is no longer an upper bound for the number of customers</strong>; </li>
<li>The format of the input is always correct; </li>
<li>Output of a <tt>double</tt> value, say <tt>d</tt>, is to be formatted with <tt>String.format("%.3f", d)</tt>; <!--
<li>Inconsistencies between sample output and actual output involving <tt>-0.000</tt> and <tt>0.000</tt> can be ignored. --> </li>
</ul>
<p>As this lab is a continuation form the previous one, your programs for <tt>rng4</tt> has been made available to you.</p>
<p>Just remember to</p>
<ul>
<li>define a <tt>Main</tt> class with the <tt>main</tt> method to handle input; </li>
<li>compile your program using
<pre>$ javac -d . *.java
</pre>
</li>
<!--
<li>check for output format correctness using the <tt>diff</tt> utility (see specific level for usage details).  Note that only <strong>one</strong> test case is provided for this; </li>
<li>check for styling errors by invoking <tt>checkstyle</tt>. For example, to check styling for all java files
<pre>$ checkstyle *.java
</pre>
</li>
<li>save a copy of all source files into the appropriate level directory (see specific level for usage details). </li>
--> 
</ul>

<h4>Level 1</h4>
<p><big><strong> Implement the customer queues </strong></big></p>
<p>Input to the program comprises (in order of presentation):</p>
<ul>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> value denoting the base seed for the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> object; </li>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> value representing the number of servers </li>
<li><strong>an <tt>int</tt> value for the maximum queue length, <tt>Q<sub>max</sub></tt></strong> </li>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> representing the number of customers (or the number of arrival events) to simulate </li>
<li>a positive <tt>double</tt> parameter for the arrival rate, &lambda; </li>
<li>a positive <tt>double</tt> parameter for the service rate, &mu; </li>
</ul>
<p>Each queue has a maximum capacity <tt>Q<sub>max</sub></tt>,  and a customer cannot join a queue that is full. Note that a customer being served is not inside the queue. When a customer arrives and all the queues are full, then the customer leaves.</p>
<p>Clearly, if <tt>Q<sub>max</sub> = 1</tt>, then the simulation reverts back to the one that allows only one waiting customer.</p>
<p>The following is a sample run of the program. Command to run the program is highlighted.   <!-- Ensure that the last line of output is followed by a newline character. --></p>

<p><big><strong> Implementing server breaks </strong></big></p>
<p>Input to the program comprises (in order of presentation):</p>
<ul>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> value denoting the base seed for the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> object; </li>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> value representing the number of servers </li>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> value for the maximum queue length, <tt>Q<sub>max</sub></tt> </li>
<li>an <tt>int</tt> representing the number of customers (or the number of arrival events) to simulate </li>
<li>a positive <tt>double</tt> parameter for the arrival rate, &lambda; </li>
<li>a positive <tt>double</tt> parameter for the service rate, &mu; </li>
<li><strong>a positive <tt>double</tt> parameter for the resting rate, &rho;</strong> </li>
<li><strong>a <tt>double</tt> parameter for the probability of resting, <tt>P<sub>r</sub></tt></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Include two events <tt>SERVER_REST</tt> and <tt>SERVER_BACK</tt>, to simulating taking a break, and returning. These events should be generated and scheduled in the simulator when the server decides to rest.</p>
<p>To decide if the server should rest, a random number uniformly drawn from <tt>[0, 1]</tt> is generated using the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> method <tt>genRandomRest()</tt>.  If the value returned is less than <tt>P<sub>r</sub></tt>, the server rests with a <tt>SERVER_REST</tt> event generated. Otherwise, it continues serving the next customer.</p>
<p>As soon as the server rests, a random rest period <tt>T<sub>r</sub></tt> is generated using the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> method <tt>genRestPeriod()</tt>.  This variable is an exponential random variable, governed by the resting rate, &rho;. A <tt>SERVER_BACK</tt> event will be scheduled at <tt>T<sub>r</sub> + now</tt>.</p>
