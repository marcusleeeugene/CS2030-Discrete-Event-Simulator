  <h3 align="center"> Project Scope </h3>
  <p>
    CS2030 (Programming Methodology II) explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and
    functional programming. Classes are conducted in JAVA.
  </p
  <p>
    This is a discrete event simulation project. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a method of simulating the behaviour
    and performance of a real-life process, facility or system. For this project, I am tasked to create a program to handle customers of a shop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, I learnt to write codes that are readable, reusable and designed for future extensions. The project is splitted in 3 parts.
